# Nature Inspired Computing for Gaming: the Flappy Bird Game

---

## Game Overview
The project itself is a copy of the Flappy Bird game with the integrated Genetic Programming algorithm. 
The game itself learns how to play and tries to maximize the lifetime of a bird.

The game classes adhere to a hierarchical structure, following the principles of OOP and respecting the principle of single responsibility.

*The game is written in Python using Pygame.*
